PyHtmlLiveStreamingServer
=========================

HTML Live Streaming Server written in Python


This was written for the purpose of testing an HLS client implementation and a quick and dirty server was required to test against.
This README is temprary until the time in which I can be bothered to update it correctly.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7
Pycrypto
libav built with HLS support.

Only tested on Linux - only because this is what I required for my work.
